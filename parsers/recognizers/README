libkerat, an experimental tuio 2.0 implementation

== TUIO 2.0 Propositions == 
- support IPv6 addressess in frm message
  /tuio2/frm f_id time [app inst {addr_sel IPv4|MAC|IPv6 addr +}]

- add sensor message such that
  /tuio2/snr pos_x pos_y [dim_x dim_y] # classic, 2d sensors
  /tuio2/snr pos_x pos_y pos_z [angle_x angle_y angle_z [dim_x dim_y dim_z dpy_x dpy_y dpy_z]] # 3d sensors
   
  since 3d sensors can have problem identyfing the mapped dimmensions and dpy (eg. kinect) and can be expected to utilize viewport

- unit of acceleration and velocity should not be normalized, rather it should be pixels per (squared) second and
  unit of angular acceleration and velocity sould be radians per (squared) second
  a) normalized speed and acceleration does not make sense if the sensor dimmensions are not enforced
  b) both radians and seconds are SI units, having this in universal unit system can be advantage
  c) 3d sensors have sensor dimmension crysis, so the normalized speed concept is useless here
