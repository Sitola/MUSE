             * Input templates are stored as vector of \ref libreco::rutils::unistroke_gesture structures.
             * This structure holds all information needed for correct gesture preprocessing.
             * Each template is resampled so it has got n-evenly spaced points (n is num_of_pts argument in constructor).
             * Then indicative angle between centroid and first point of template is computed and template is rotated so this angle is set to 0째.
             * Template is scaled uniformly to the bounding box (side length of bounding box is scale_box parameter of constructor).
             * Each template is translated so its new centroid is the origin (origin is orig argument in constructor).
             * In addition if template has got revert attribute set to true, it is processed also in reverse order of points,
             * this ensures that for example circle template made clockwise will be also stored in reverse order (counterclockwise).
             * 
             * \param tmpls         unprocessed templates, which will be processed according to template attributes and constructor parameters
             * \param num_of_pts    number of points in each gesture after resample method call
             * \param orig          gesture will be translated so this point is the new centroid of gesture
             * \param rot_down      angle which specifies down limit of rotation range used for searching distance at best angle
             * \param rot_up        angle which specifies up limit of rotation range used for searching distance at best angle
             * \param rot_thresh    if rotation change in recognition process is less than threshold recognition is done
             * \param scale_box     side length of bounding box where gesture will be scaled
