2013-04-07 - Libkerat 1.0.0

The Libkerat server has undergone severe changes,
mainly the tuio/osc bundle commision mechanism.
The original method server::send() has now been
replaced with 4 smaller functions, 2 of them being
pure virtuals: (prepare_bundle, run_adaptors,
output_check, commit). This sequence is now set
in motion by call to send() method. This change
was required by the newly added server-side adaptor
api.

The simple_client was modified to allow passing
unknown messages as raw OSC messages (see 
generic_osc_message class and corresponding parsers).
Container used for parser result processing is now
vector instead of list.

An interresting example of server adaptor api
can be seen in append_adaptor (server adaptor
that modifies the bundle contend by appending
or preppending the bundle with given messages).
The forwarding_listener is now built on this
new api and is way better than it was before.

The default compilation mode is noncompliant,
see configure for details.
